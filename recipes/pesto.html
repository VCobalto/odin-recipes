        <p>
            Pesto alla Genovese is a classic cold sauce from the Liguria region of Italy. It's perfect as <strong>pasta sauce or as a topping for pizza and bruschetta</strong>. <br>
            The process is extremely simple and quick, especially if you use a food processor, but the flavour is incomparable to any store-bought version you can find out there. <br> 
            Now let's get to it!
        </p>


        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <p>
            <ul class="ingredients">
                <li>90gr basil leaves (washed and dried)</li>
                <li>120-150ml extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>90gr Parmigiano Reggiano (if unavailable use a very old aged cheddar, <strong>don't use 'parmesan'</strong>)</li>
                <li>30gr pine nuts (if not available, use walnuts and/or almonds instead)</li>
                <li>1-2 cloves of garlic (optional)</li>
                <li>salt to taste (optional)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>


        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <p>
            <ol class="steps">
                <li>(optional) To prevent oxydation you can boil a pot of water, turn off the burner and briefly blanch about 2/3 of the basil leaves.</li>
                <li>Put the pine nuts and garlic in your mortar or food processor (both give very good results) and grind it to a coarse paste.</li>
                <li>Add the basil leaves to the pine nuts and grind. Add the oil as needed if grinding becomes difficult.</li>
                <li>Grate the cheese <strong>using a fine shred grater</strong> and mix it in.</li>
                <li>Taste the sauce and add salt to taste.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            If you are going to use pesto as pasta sauce, add it to the cooked and drained pasta and mix evenly before serving. Make sure <strong>not to heat the pesto on the stove</strong>, as it would alter the flavour. <br>
            As with all foods that are prone to oxydation, oxygen is one of the main enemies of pesto. To preserve it's aroma and vivid green color, make sure to store any pesto you won't eat right away in an airtight container and cover the top of the sauce with a thin layer of olive oil. <br>
            You can store the pesto in the fridge for 2-3 days or even freeze it for 3-4 months in single portion containers. In this case, when you are ready to thaw it, add the thin layer of olive oil to the surface of the sauce and leave it in the fridge over night.
