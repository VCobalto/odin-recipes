                <li>Add any of the other optional ingredients such as tomato or tabasco by gently mixing the in with a circular motion, as to not alter the overall texture.</li>

        <p>
            Guacamole is best enjoyed fresh, but it can last in the fridge for up to 48 hours or it can even be frozen for 2-3 months. <br>
            If you decide to store it in the fridge, use a well closing container, make sure to add a bit more lime juice and cover the top with plastic wrap to reduce the exposure to air. This way you will prevent the avocado from turning brown too quickly. <br>
            If you decided to freeze some of your guacamole, thaw it overnight in the fridge and consume within the next day.
