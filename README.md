# odin-recipes

A simple brutalist webstite about recipes, created as part of the Odin Project Foundations Course.

The main purpose was to familiarize with the html boilerplate, with adding links and images to a webpage and using ordered and unordered lists.  
It was useful to learn how to familiarize with the process of creating GitHub repositories and using Git to save the project as it developed.  
It also gave me the opportunity to begin to get a sense for when and how often to commit changes to the project and practice the skill of writing good commit messages.
